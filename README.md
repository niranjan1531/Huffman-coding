# Huffman-encoding

This is a simple C program which demonstrates the implementation of Huffman encoding.

The program takes a text file(.txt file) as input and generates codes to each character using Huffman tree. The program takes into consideration only characters in lowercase.

The program displays Huffman codes for characters in the text file and also the size the file would occupy with and without encoding, as output.
